      Week 2: 
    This article was very interesting to me and a few key points stood out; I took some time to understand but in essence, my takeaway is that mail art is a medium of art where the focus is not on the mailing aspect, but rather using the postal system creatively as an outlet of art. For a concrete example, the EAMIS was a system made by artists in Denmark, which was an alternative to traditional postal services and allowed artists to send message of many different types of forms, creating their own kind of independent art-sharing system.
One part that I found very interesting was the "big monster" metaphor. The author compares our traditional postal system as a "big monster", which represents the bureaucracy and bigger restrictions that artists often have to go against. Thus, mail art is a way to challenge this system and create an open, free exchange of ideas - as the author says, "knocking on the monster's door".
All in all, people often misunderstand mail art as simply artistic photocards. Previously, I've never heard of mail art, so I would probably imagine something similar. But the real value of mail art is the art of how free responses can create a global network of artists, where the real art itself is the act of exchanging.

 

My questions:

1. I feel like in today's world, communication is instant (texting, calling, and such). In what ways does Mail Art challenge the fast-paced, impersonal nature of modern digital communication? And could something like a text be considered mail art?

2. I'm pretty interested in cybersecurity, and among the issues of cyber today are mass surveilance and digital commodification of communication. In what ways can the principles of Mail Art (anonymity, slow communication etc) be adapted to sort of counteract or challenge these cybersecurity issues?</span>

      Week 3: 
    I enjoyed reading these articles and their discussions on what it means to be a website and how knowledge is influenced by our hyperconnected world. For the first article, I liked how the first author's idea of a website as both "subject and object" and a "living, temporal space" challenges how we traditionally think of digital creations. I also found the author's definition of a website as "inherently unfinished" to be super insightful. When I work on web development, I always considered my end goal to be successfully finishing, deploying, and ending a project. But the author asks, "What happens to websites after death?" It made me reflect on about a sense of digital mortality and the legacy of these interactive spaces, and how in truth websites are always evolving and changing - whether it be adding updates, feedback, maintenance, etc. This perspective made me appreciate the impermanence of websites.

Additionally, Édouard's essay was also very interesting to me. One part that stood out was his the idea that "nothing exists in isolation." His description of forming "personal abstractions" through intertextual exploration challenges the way knowledge is usually consumed (in linear-type formats). To me, this notion feels especially relevant since we live in a time where everything is hyperconnected and you have so much knowledge accessible to you instantly.

I also liked his metaphor of "conspiracy-theory mapping with push pins and thread" as a learning tool. Although I didn't quite understand it at first, my understanding is that while unconventional, it illustrates the value of visually mapping relationships between ideas. This approach could transform how we teach other people, trying to help empower them to create personal meaning from what they learn instead of just absorbing information.

 

Questions:

1. In the first article, the author asks, "What happens to websites after death?" I was trying to think of an answer and so was thinking about this question: with so many websites in this world, are they preserved as relics of their time?

2. A lot of the times, an imperfection or error in a creative work can be seen as a feature rather than a flaw. Can that be the same case in a website, or are websites considered too technical?</p>

      Week 4: I found this week's reading to be very interesting, and reading the author's Lialina’s of Geocities made me think about how easily we can lose entire parts of our digital past. The article talks about how Geocities was once a huge community where everyday people learned simple HTML and formed online “neighborhoods.” When Yahoo! shut it down, so many personal pages vanished overnight, leaving behind lots of broken links and missing images. I also though that it was a positive touch that groups like the Archive Team worked hard to save what they could, because looking at these old pages helps us remember a time when the web was more playful and community-driven. It also shows how quickly internet culture can change—and how important it is to preserve these moments before they disappear completely. This reminds me that the stories and personal creativity found in places like Geocities matter, and that corporate decisions can suddenly erase them if we aren’t careful.

Two questions that I have are:

How can we protect our "personal histories" (like the auther mentioned) online when big companies can shut down services at any time?
How can we learn that lesson from the creativit yof Geocities and apply that to today’s web communities?

      Week 5: I thought that this week's reading was interesting, as Ludovico’s Post-Digital Print challenges the idea that print is obsolete in the digital age. Instead of viewing digital and print as opposing forces, he argues that their relationship is "fluid, with new hybrid possibilities emerging".  I found this to be particularly worthwile because in today's day and age, I'm very used to digital publishing being accessible at the tip of our fingers. Yet, I would argue that print and phyiscal books still remains valuable as a tangible and cultural object. The rise of DIY publishing and crowdfunding that the author talks about demonstrates that physical books still hold significance, not just as content carriers but as artistic and collectible items. This perspective makes me reflect on how I consume media—while I rely heavily on digital content for convenience, there is still something irreplaceable about the physicality of a book.

In what ways can print and digital media complement rather than compete with each other? In what ways do they currently compete with eachother?

      Week 6: This reading goes in depth about alt-text, which is text describing image that helps with web accessibility. I've worked with metadata and tags before, but when I was implementing them the main goal in mind was to promote user outreach and get more people to click on a website/buy a product if it's associated with some key search words. Now, thinking back, I didn't realize it but metadata and alt-text serves a much more important purpose: making the web more accessible as a non-visual alternative.

I found it really interesting how the author connects alt-text to poetry. I like how they explained that both poetry and alt-text require the author to put in a lot of thought and care into what words they are writing, not just simply stating facts or summarizing. What are the connotations that we are using? What is the voice that the reader hears? These are questions that we ask both in poetry and writing alt-text. Just like poetry invokes feeling, alt-text aims to invoke that same feeling that people gain from images, but this time expressed through words.

My questions:

1. What are other things on the web that similarly improve other types of accessibility, such as language barriers or hard of hearing?

2. The author mentioned "word economy" and how it's better to be concise, which I found interesting. What are the downsides to over-describing and a large word count?

      Week 8: I thought that the author's discussion of lingua franca was really interesting and something worth exploring. In terms of computer science, what would a lingua franca for coding look like? There are many different coding languages that we can use in the world, but like the author emphasized, they are all built on the foundations of English. However, the author also talked about how it's basically impossible to create a fully usable coding language in a different language because of the thousands of libraries and naming conventions developed by other programmers over the years (that are based on English names). His project قلب serves an example for this disparity. In this case, then how can we achieve a sort of lingua franca among people from different cultures today, where no language has a complete linguistic dominance over another?

I also found what the author said about naming being deeply cultural to be super interesting. For example, our parents gave my sister and I more "American" first names to better fit in as we were born and raised here. With an American first name and Chinese last name, I've grown up in both cultures and I definitely feel the cultural significance that names have in both. The author mentioned that for people who have to use English names, it ends in them having to "abandon purity, ...and defeat your own purpose for existing", which I have a slightly different viewpoint on. I feel like it is possible that people can combine and celebrate more that just one culture; instead of losing the "purity" of one, it's possible to also blend and share multiple cultures. But I definitely agree with him that in these cases, when one of them (English) is overwhelmingly dominant in all aspects of the world, that is not equitable. It throws off the balance and forces people to assimilate.

 

Questions: (also above)

1. In terms of computer science, what would a lingua franca for coding look like? 

2. How can we achieve a sort of lingua franca among people from different cultures today, where no language has a complete linguistic dominance over another?

      Week 10: For this week's reading, I learned a lot of new things; namely being introduced to Gestalt principles and the way we perceive visual information. The author talks about how our brains don’t just see individual elements like dots, colors, or brightness levels; instead, we naturally group things into meaningful patterns. The example about seeing two faces rather than a sum of individual brightness values was really standout to me: it made me thikn about how perception is more about relationships than isolated details.

I also found the section on Max Wertheimer’s Dot Essay really interesting. It’s interesting how our brains instinctively organize scattered dots into patterns, even when other arrangements are theoretically possible. This made me think about how designers use composition, spacing, and alignment to guide the viewer’s eye. The idea that perception is both structured and flexible is really relevant to graphic design.

One thing I’m curious about is how these Gestalt principles apply beyond static design, like in motion graphics, UX/UI design, or even AI-driven image recognition. Another question I had (more of just a wondering thought) was if ML/AI could be trained to recognize Gestalt patterns in images the way humans do? Since human perception naturally groups elements, could an AI model be developed to detect visual information in a similar way, or is it not possible?

      Week 12: This week’s reading introduced me to the concept of the “poetics of absence,” which made me reflect a lot about how we use technology to connect (or fail to connect). I never heard of String Games before, but the idea of using early teleconferencing and a collaborative string game to explore memory across distance feels very relevant to today’s digital world. Frenkel’s substitution of physical string for gestures and symbolic inputs (like a letter, word, image, etc.) was really powerful—it made me realize how much is lost in translation when we try to communicate or perform across screens.

One part that stood out to me was the“X” on the bodies of the performers, which was like a visual metaphor for absence and erasure even while they were being recorded. It made me think of how digital archives or even things like social media feeds create the illusion of eternal presence, when in reality they can obscure or flatten real lived experiences.

My question is, how can technologies preserve memory more fully in today's world?

      Week 13: I liked Soulellis' writing on the history and origins and the digital terms we know today (like feed or post) and the deeper issues and nuances behind it. I found the author's discussion of feeds interesting, where he talked about how the digital feed we know now actually originated from the electrical telegraphic transmission machines from 1840s. It's the idea of a flowing message from either rolls of paper or digital "feeds", but I found it interesting because I was able to make that connection that I hadn't previously realized before. I also like the way he formatted the article; when he was talking about how a post is like a signal that interrupts, the corresponding image of an interruption consistently "interrupted" the article and broke up his words to force the reader to pay attention to that picture. I found that pretty interesting and engaging.

My two questions are: how does AI-generated content fall into the definition of post or genuine content? And also, how will AI exacerbate (or maybe not exacerbate) the "trust issues" on today's internet that the author talks about?

      Week 14: I really enjoyed this week's reading because I thought it was a very easy to understand reading that unexpectedly made me think a lot deeper about the functions of our computers in today's society and the effects of what I do daily with my computer that I haven't stopped to think about before. The author mentioned something interesting; that "The computer is always trying to relate to human history because people modeled computers after their world." This is something that I never stopped to think about, but it makes sense that computers, as a man-made product, strive to follow human history in some way because they were modeled after what we know and perceive. One real life small example I can think of is how early computer interfaces were designed to mimic physical desktops like with folders, files, and trash bins, because it helped users relate to something familiar from their everyday lives. This kind of relates to last week's reading, where the author of that article traced different terminology in computers like posts, feed, etc. to their origins as real physical history in our world.

My questions are:

1. I enjoyed the story and the path that the readers were took on, but I'm not sure I fully understood the nuances. What does the beyond exactly represent in today's real world?

what does the beyond represent?

2. The book mentions that "we often experience software as a form of control". How does this relate to ai; do we control ai; does ai control us?
